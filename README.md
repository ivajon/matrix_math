## What is this?

This is my matrix math library.
I intend to use it for some hobby projects, mostly for neural networks.

## How it works

Every type in this library is generic, so a matrix/vector can contain anny data supporting the basic
operations.

## How to use it

See the examples in the `examples` folder. ( Future )

See the tests in the src files.

## Future plans

- Implement usage of tpu and gpus for faster computation.
- Implement usage of multiple threads for faster computation.
- Implement more optimized algorithms.
- Implement for specific compile targets, such as RISC-v vector extensions.
- Implement more mathematical operations
- Implement more rigorous error handling.
- Implement more rigorous tests.
