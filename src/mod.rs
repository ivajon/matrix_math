//! # What is this?
//! This is a Rust library for linear algebra, it is completely generic and can be used for any type of numeric matrix
//! # Why is this in Rust?
//! This is because Rust is a statically typed language, and it is a good way to learn how to use Rust, it also allows
//! for static sizing of matricies at compile time, this is a hughe advantage over dynamic sizing in other languages
//! # How do I use this?
//! This library will be used for the neural network library, but it can be used for other things as well.
//! Ideally I would want to use this for embedded systems but due to the lack of fpu's It would need special care,
//! this could be done by not casting the matrix to a f32 matrix, but instead using the u32 values or similar instead,
//! this would however require a lot of rethinking since neural nets usually work with values in the range of 0-1,
//! and this would require a lot of rethinking of the math behind the neural nets.
//! # How do I use this in Rust?
//! ```rust
//! use matrs::matrix::Matrix;
//! let m1 = Matrix::<f32, 2, 2>::new();
//! let m2 = Matrix::<f32, 2, 2>::new();
//! let m3 = m1 + m2;
//! ```
//! # Future work
//! This library is currently in a very early stage of development, I would like to add more features to it,
//! I would love to add support for interopperability with c and python.
//! I would love to add support for gpu / tpu / other hardware accelerators.
